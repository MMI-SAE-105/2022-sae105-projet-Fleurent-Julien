    <p>Artist known now for making some music. Franck Rivoire better known as Danger shows
        us his career transition.</p>

    <h2>Past of the Electro artist</h2>

    <p>Danger is an artist who has been influenced by Capcom or Konami. At the beginning, he
        started as a graphic designer by creating a comic strip under the name of his pseudonym
        “Danger”. Having done music theory for several years, he focused on electronic music,
        which is when his career began.</p>


    <h2>July 2013 et Taiko 太鼓 </h2>

    <p>In 2014, he released his EP named July 2013. This EP is about the creation of his mask that
        he created. This mask is strongly inspired by the universe of video games. It reminds us of
        the black mages of the video game saga Final Fantasy made by Square Enix. This mask is
        for him, a way to beat his shyness. In 2017, he released his first album called Taiko. He will
        do the first parts of the tour with Madeon or Porter Robinson. Moreover, his music names
        have a little specificity. These are the times when Danger finished his compositions,
        except for the remixes he does. But he didn’t make music only for himself!</p>

    <h2>Video games, Furi and Haven by The Game Bakers</h2>

    <p>While composing his own music, he also participated in the creation of music for video
        games. In particular at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Bakers">The Games Bakers</a>, a French video game company based
        in
        Montpellier. He composed for two games. Furi and Haven where he composed 5 musics
        for Furi, a Shoot’em up where you have to beat the guardians to finally have freedom in a
        prison. And Haven where he did all the soundtrack of the game.
    </p>

    <p><q>I worked on the music during the whole development of the game. I started when Haven
            was still just characters and a script written on a few sheets of paper, and I continued
            until... three weeks ago! At the last moment, I was still finishing little things on some of the
            music.</q> But it’s not just here that video games are taking hold</p>
