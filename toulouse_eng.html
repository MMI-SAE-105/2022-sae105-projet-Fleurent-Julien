    <p>Known for its innovations in aeronautics, Toulouse is one of the largest cities in France
        with almost 500,000 inhabitants. But why do we often hear about it?</p>

    <h2>Toulouse, the pink city</h2>

    <p>When you hear Toulouse, you asking sometimes why it is called the pink city?
        Let’s take a look to his history! At the time of the Romans, they settled in Toulouse and
        used a special brick which gave this pink colour and then over the centuries, Toulouse
        wanted to build buildings using the roman brick.</p>

    <h2>Aeronautics, but also medicine!</h2>

    <p>We forget the fact that Toulouse has a campus that exists and is mainly based on the fight
        against cancer, the Oncopole. This brings together health care centers, pharmaceutical
        industries such as Sanofi and research laboratories. Their aim is to apply techniques to
        find a cure for cancer. One of the techniques, “proton therapy”, consists of better
        targeting tumours while keeping the healthy tissue of the patients. However, this requires
        a very high precision!</p>

    <h2>Un centre d’innovation</h2>

    <p>We often innovate in Toulouse, but there is a building who’s reserved for this, the B612,
        the Toulouse Aerospace Innovation Centre. The name obviously refers to the emblematic
        book of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince">The little prince</a> published in 1943. For them, it
        allows
        for the strengthening of innovations between public and private laboratories.
        Particularly in the field of aeronautics and space. They being financed by the European
        Union and being committed to the Occitanie - Midi Pyrénées Region with the ERDF
        (European Regional Development Fund), it tries to welcome actors of research and
        technological development in the field of aeronautics.
        After having seen the technological innovations in aeronautics, we are going to move
        towards a future masterpiece but also technological masterpiece
